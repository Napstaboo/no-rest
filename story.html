            <h2>Hill House part 17</h2>
            <p>You asked me in my previous post how I survive. Every night now they claw against the windows and beg to be let in.
                It's an awful noise, like scraping a fork against a plate.
                They sound familiar but it's been so long that I can't remember what a person sounds like. I have just enough
                left in me to remember how to keep them out. Every night I follow these instructions exactly, and if you find yourself
                here one day, you will too.
            </p><br>

            <p>1. Do not turn the lights off. Ever. Sometimes the lights flicker and
                for half a second, their eyes are beautiful glowing stars that cut through the dark and know my secrets.
                For half a second, I am filled with the uncontrollable urge to let them in.
                Then the lights return.
            </p>

            <p>2. Mask up in the kitchen and anywhere else where you see the dust. You'll know when you see it.
                It looks a lot like miniscule insects floating in the air in hibernation. Completely odourless. 
                 N95s don't cut it. You'll want a P100 respirator, it's the only reason I'm not one of them yet.</p>

            <p>3. If you hear footsteps in the next room, do not investigate. Leave a plate with some food outside the door and come back later.
                If the food's gone, it's safe to enter. Otherwise, KEEP OUT.
            </p>

            <p>4. Occasionally they're in my dreams. I don't know how to stop them there. Sleep is all I have, and sometimes, they're there too.
                Most nights though, I am completely out in a blissful dreamless sleep. I've even gotten used to the clawing.
            </p>

            <p>I'll add more of my routine soon, but please... keep the questions coming, it's all I have to remember there's an outside world.</p><br>
